# Mr. Shareman
***
Have you ever been in the situation in which you need to give someone your contact information, but struggling to do so because you left home you business card? There must be an app for that, right?

**Well, it is now :)** I coded and designed Mr. Shareman. Simple PWA to help you to quickly share/show text on the screen of your device. You can generate QR code as well.
